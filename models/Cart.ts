/**
 * One cart per customer, stored server-side.
 *
 * A cart is a list of lines, and every line carries its own loaf: either a
 * plain loaf, or a topping folded through the loaf the customer picked for it.
 * "Multigrain on Classic" and "Chocolate on Whole Wheat" are two separate
 * lines, each priced as topping + loaf.
 *
 * Product references rather than copies: a cart should reflect the menu as it
 * is now, so a price edited in the CMS is the price the customer sees. Lines
 * whose products have since been deleted are dropped when the cart is read.
 *
 * Uniqueness (each topping once, each plain loaf once) is enforced in
 * lib/cart.ts rather than by an index — it is a rule about a line's key, which
 * a Mongo unique index cannot express inside an embedded array.
